Cool, your friends are free! Are you ready to socialize? [BATTLE] [HANGING OUT]

[CLUB - winning] The club meeting was awesome - everyone listened to what you had to say, and you feel really excited for your next meeting. [AFTER SCHOOL 2]
[CLUB - losing] The club meeting was a mess. No one wanted to listen to you and the club is going in a direction that you never wanted it to go. Very disappointing.

[HANGING OUT - winning] It was great to catch up with your friends and forget about school for a while. [AFTER SCHOOL 2]
[HANGING OUT - losing] Your friends ignored you the entire time, even though they invited you, and you felt uncomfortable that they kept making jokes about the queer community. You didn’t feel like you could speak up, though, and was quietly uncomfortable. [AFTER SCHOOL 2]

[HOMEWORK - winning] All right, easy homework! You’re done with it now and don’t have to worry about it for the rest of the night. [AFTER SCHOOL 2]

[PARTY - winning] The party had great music and you just might have hooked up with this really hot person. You even got their number! [AFTER SCHOOL 2]
[PARTY - losing] It was a horrible mess of people - you could barely move at all and got crushed in the crowd towards the front, and had your hearing blasted out by the speakers. Your ears are still ringing from the music… [AFTER SCHOOL 2]
