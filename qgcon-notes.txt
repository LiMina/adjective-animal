What is QGCon?
- This was started in the Metrion (?)
- An awareness that academia was behind regarding the modern gaming industry
- Create a space where academia and queer game makers and players could come together
- This is the second year of QGCon

This year:
- Gamergate is out there (and happening)
- We needed a group of people to be welcoming and comforting
- Many people are feeling unsafe and unable to voice themselves right now
- Hopefully this will be a safe space

Crash Courses
- 5 minute microtalks

Games 101
- introduction to games who aren't as familiar with games
- games were originally made of things like paper, wood, bone, etc.
    - a way to sort of make sense of the world
- machines: games became industrialized
    - particularly through computers
    - became a thing that makes money; maybe a bit exclusive
- core vs. casual
    - core: military strategy, fighting, etc.; less accessible
    - casual: experiences that are more accessible to everyone
- AAA vs. Indie
    - AAA: big, expensive games; requires a lot of time and money
    - Indie: often cheaper and more accessible for people to enjoy

A specific gaming culture around masculinity and heteronormativity
- "cuties killing video games"

The Games Industry
- currently the definition of games is mostly digital
- 1950s: first games distributed on computers (also the first indie games appeared)
- Academia was the only place you could kind of play on computers, so it became a bit privileged.
- AAA
    - a small set of games produced with huge budgets
    - for a while, this was the only thing that people saw
    - played on consoles or PCs with a narrow set of themes
- Indie
    - late 2000s, we start to see these games more visibly
    - these had been around but not really out there to the public
    - iPhones, Wii, these technologies began to change who played games
- F2P
    - free to play / freemium
    - defined by how it makes money
    - gives you a small amount of enjoyment; you can pay to accelerate how much fun you have with it though
- Serious Games
    - defined by thematic content
    - disease, public policy, etc.
- Experimental
    - defined by what things are played on/with
- LARP
    - live action roleplay
    - pretty broad, and has a lot of potential for exploring some serious things

Games Studies 101
- Game studies is very young
    - social science, humanities, industry/practice/engineering
    - it's not very cemented into academia right now
- Terminology
    - Operational logic
    - Procedural rhetoric
    - narratology vs. ludology
        - narratology: focused on story
        - ludology: focused on game mechanics, "game formalism"; has a tendency to exclude people
    - identification
        - player vs avatar
        - the incorporation of the avatar into the player
        - how does the player view themselves when they play?

Queer Studies
- this is more about the fact that we all think like queer scholars
- the studies began in the mid 80s and has been kind of hidden in departments
- academics talking about queer issues
    - a way of seeing things that are queer in whatever field you're working in
- queer studies scholars are (usually) queer
- seeing things queerly
- if we abstract it out into a way of thinking/a series of ideologies and finding the queer in things that don't seem to be queer
- what it might mean to think queerly
    - failure itself in games is a certain representation of queerness

Call out Academics!

Queer Games
- 1990s-2000
    - queer games have existed for as long as there have been games
    - marginal developers outside of AAA making these queer games
- 2010s
    - a group of people and communities making queerness in games more visible
    - notable games: dys4ia, lim, howling dogs (moving forward with Twine), mainichi, gone home
    - Twine: text based, experience based
    - some of the queer games has been spilling into more mainstream AAA tradition
- Now
    - even in the last month or so, even with Gamergate, there have been a lot of interesting queer games coming out
    - they are not from the usual voices we hear about, either
    - queer games are becoming less about a particular scene with figureheads, and more about a group of people coming together and making things

Racism, Sexism, and Social Justice Warriors in Video Game Culture
- presented by Lisa Nakamura
- "I don't think that journalism understands what journalism is" - regards to calling Anita Sarkeesian a journalist
- Gaming at the Edge by Adrienne Shaw
- Gamergate - there has been so much written about it already
- Social Justice Warrior (SJW)
    - Games have always been at the center of this
    - Straight white male is the opposite of the SJW usually (queer, female, POC)
- The idea of the gamer has changed
- UrbanDictionary definition is accusatory
    - seen as someone who is a crusader who is outside of the gaming culture
    - racialized other
    - queer women of color have always been around, but they are considered immigrants of gaming culture
    - the citation makes it clear that they're considered native to somewhere else like Livejournal and Tumblr
- There is a need for people who can add a different voice
    - You can't just add people of color to mainstream culture and expect it to be enough
- Procedural meritocracy
    - Right goes to those who can create a win condition for themselves and a lose condition for others and achieve victory for their demographics
    - "Real gamer" - this need for female players to prove themselves by beating everyone else.
- The only girl who deserves saving is the only one who doesn't need it - "the final girl"
    - the girl who gains the right to live
- "Transcending a talented tenth" - W.B. Dubois
    - disprove the alleged inferiority
    - really elitist, though, and is therefore problematic
    - cannot uplift every person, and there it results in leaving behind people
- Talented tength in the gaming community generates 133t people
- Beliving in meritocracy is not the way to go
- What are games but the posibility of happiness?
- We attach the most strongly to the things that are supposed to make you happy but also are incredibly disappointing
- Queer players are only able to match by doing well - otherwise, they are believed to not have the right to argue their point
- The game is stacked against minorities
- Games are a literal manifestation of life's discrination
- leveling up in gaming is not the way to achieve social justice
- SJW example: some games allow players the option to play as this "ideal" SJW example
    - Edge of Tomorrow
- SJW example: "bad" example because they aren't "fair" and don't play the game and aren't this ideal person
    - rude, sincere, and rejects the image of the ideal
- being tired of being the only person who brings up race or gender or sexual orientation
- some people say we should ignore Gamergate: focuses on cis hetero white males in games
- what are people outside of the norm actually doing?
    - Journey: wanted avatars to not have arms so you can't shoot people
        - speech is not possible (you can't call anyone anything)
        - claim that this is a AAA game as opposed to an independent game
- it's time for gamers and scholars ot untangle the complex world of gaming culture
- we have the gaming world's attention - what will we do with it?
- discriminatory behaviors are often blown off as just trolling
    - "it's not about expressing an opinion; it's about getting something done" 
    - claimed to be something to throw people off so that you can do better
    - a claim that it's just to get an advantage
- full essays and articles at lisanakamura.net, comments to lnakamur@umich.edu
- platform makers want to create as many channels of communication as possible
    - not all of this may be welcome, though
- it's kind of utopian idea that you can create civility through design
- still feeds into the idea of the talented tenth, where a maker reveals they're some minority after success
- why does the game create this identity for us?
    - we imagine we can earn our way
    - the idea that if we try harder, we will get half as much and that will be enough
- what is a good player?
    - games create this condition and favor certain abilities
- competition is often seen as versus
    - this has a lot to do with our own selfish wants
    - what are we doing in relation to one another
- the nature of compeitive games and the way they make money
    - undermines teaching civility
    - there are a lot of limits
    - limited by money and profit
    - minecraft as an example of competitiveness but also gives you the ability to build things
    - sandbox games represent a different posibility and more gender balanced
    - but even competitive games should (and can) have this ability to build and create in a more equal way
- outside of the gamer community into the larger culture and social justice issues and movements
    - to a certain extent in television and movies, no one wants to see these kinds of representations (or don't want their children exposed to them)
    - is there a way that things in gamer culture make it to the larger scheme of things?
    - part of the internet are made safer for people, but gaming is often seen as impossible
        - games and youtube comments are places that a lot of people have given up as safe spaces
- there are specific minorities and gaming cultures in the US, but what about internationally?
    - two tendencies that are problematic: the "white knight" (gender binary and masculinity), and the young female (the idea of sacrifice that is very feminine and needing to sacrifice their online identity to do social justice - kind of joan of arc narrative)
    - transnationality: 
        - independent publishers going out of print just like independent game makers: both have struggles with trying to stay afloat
        - try to be non-hierarchical
- drawing a line between procedural meritocracy vs. just competitiveness
    - "I don't want to discount the pleasure of kicking someone's ass"
    - issues of pleasure versus buying into the oppression/the established system
- breaking the law is part of being an SJW (often?)
- the cruel optimism that your labor will be needed if you work hard enough, but it's not really always attainable because society may not want it
    - ignoring people's needs --> draws people to games
- competitive games often rewards those who have a lot of time, and who has a lot of time?
    - privilege of having that kind of leisure time
    - women just have less leisure time than men do: don't really have that capital either compared to men
    - playing games requires a lot of capital
- farmville
    - the whole discourse about SJW is often focused on AAA games with shooter/violent games
    - social/casual games as a separate system that have many more women playing them
    - but how does this parallel ecosystem, that is more friendly to women, but how does this affect the gamer culture?
    - anxiety over the culture changing, but also the more time put into casual games, creates less for other kind of "big" games
- journey
    - competitive games make it easy for you to hate on people when they're on a team you're gaming with and they don't pull their weight
    - creation of games that encourage kindness towards other gamers
    - it's a matter of education? riot compaign for people to be really nice to each other because supposedly statistics that they do better than way
        - this only really persisted for a bit before toxicity creeped back though
