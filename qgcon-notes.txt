What is QGCon?
- This was started in the Metrion (?)
- An awareness that academia was behind regarding the modern gaming industry
- Create a space where academia and queer game makers and players could come together
- This is the second year of QGCon

This year:
- GamerGate is out there (and happening)
- We needed a group of people to be welcoming and comforting
- Many people are feeling unsafe and unable to voice themselves right now
- Hopefully this will be a safe space

Crash Courses
- 5 minute microtalks

Games 101
- introduction to games who aren't as familiar with games
- games were originally made of things like paper, wood, bone, etc.
    - a way to sort of make sense of the world
- machines: games became industrialized
    - particularly through computers
    - became a thing that makes money; maybe a bit exclusive
- core vs. casual
    - core: military strategy, fighting, etc.; less accessible
    - casual: experiences that are more accessible to everyone
- AAA vs. Indie
    - AAA: big, expensive games; requires a lot of time and money
    - Indie: often cheaper and more accessible for people to enjoy

A specific gaming culture around masculinity and heteronormativity
- "cuties killing video games"

The Games Industry
- currently the definition of games is mostly digital
- 1950s: first games distributed on computers (also the first indie games appeared)
- Academia was the only place you could kind of play on computers, so it became a bit privileged.
- AAA
    - a small set of games produced with huge budgets
    - for a while, this was the only thing that people saw
    - played on consoles or PCs with a narrow set of themes
- Indie
    - late 2000s, we start to see these games more visibly
    - these had been around but not really out there to the public
    - iPhones, Wii, these technologies began to change who played games
- F2P
    - free to play / freemium
    - defined by how it makes money
    - gives you a small amount of enjoyment; you can pay to accelerate how much fun you have with it though
- Serious Games
    - defined by thematic content
    - disease, public policy, etc.
- Experimental
    - defined by what things are played on/with
- LARP
    - live action roleplay
    - pretty broad, and has a lot of potential for exploring some serious things

Games Studies 101
- Game studies is very young
    - social science, humanities, industry/practice/engineering
    - it's not very cemented into academia right now
- Terminology
    - Operational logic
    - Procedural rhetoric
    - narratology vs. ludology
        - narratology: focused on story
        - ludology: focused on game mechanics, "game formalism"; has a tendency to exclude people
    - identification
        - player vs avatar
        - the incorporation of the avatar into the player
        - how does the player view themselves when they play?

Queer Studies
- this is more about the fact that we all think like queer scholars
- the studies began in the mid 80s and has been kind of hidden in departments
- academics talking about queer issues
    - a way of seeing things that are queer in whatever field you're working in
- queer studies scholars are (usually) queer
- seeing things queerly
- if we abstract it out into a way of thinking/a series of ideologies and finding the queer in things that don't seem to be queer
- what it might mean to think queerly
    - failure itself in games is a certain representation of queerness

Call out Academics!

Queer Games
- 1990s-2000
    - queer games have existed for as long as there have been games
    - marginal developers outside of AAA making these queer games
- 2010s
    - a group of people and communities making queerness in games more visible
    - notable games: dys4ia, lim, howling dogs (moving forward with Twine), mainichi, gone home
    - Twine: text based, experience based
    - some of the queer games has been spilling into more mainstream AAA tradition
- Now
    - even in the last month or so, even with GamerGate, there have been a lot of interesting queer games coming out
    - they are not from the usual voices we hear about, either
    - queer games are becoming less about a particular scene with figureheads, and more about a group of people coming together and making things
