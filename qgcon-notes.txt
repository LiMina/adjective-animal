What is QGCon?
- This was started in the Metrion (?)
- An awareness that academia was behind regarding the modern gaming industry
- Create a space where academia and queer game makers and players could come together
- This is the second year of QGCon

This year:
- Gamergate is out there (and happening)
- We needed a group of people to be welcoming and comforting
- Many people are feeling unsafe and unable to voice themselves right now
- Hopefully this will be a safe space

Crash Courses
- 5 minute microtalks

Games 101
- introduction to games who aren't as familiar with games
- games were originally made of things like paper, wood, bone, etc.
    - a way to sort of make sense of the world
- machines: games became industrialized
    - particularly through computers
    - became a thing that makes money; maybe a bit exclusive
- core vs. casual
    - core: military strategy, fighting, etc.; less accessible
    - casual: experiences that are more accessible to everyone
- AAA vs. Indie
    - AAA: big, expensive games; requires a lot of time and money
    - Indie: often cheaper and more accessible for people to enjoy

A specific gaming culture around masculinity and heteronormativity
- "cuties killing video games"

The Games Industry
- currently the definition of games is mostly digital
- 1950s: first games distributed on computers (also the first indie games appeared)
- Academia was the only place you could kind of play on computers, so it became a bit privileged.
- AAA
    - a small set of games produced with huge budgets
    - for a while, this was the only thing that people saw
    - played on consoles or PCs with a narrow set of themes
- Indie
    - late 2000s, we start to see these games more visibly
    - these had been around but not really out there to the public
    - iPhones, Wii, these technologies began to change who played games
- F2P
    - free to play / freemium
    - defined by how it makes money
    - gives you a small amount of enjoyment; you can pay to accelerate how much fun you have with it though
- Serious Games
    - defined by thematic content
    - disease, public policy, etc.
- Experimental
    - defined by what things are played on/with
- LARP
    - live action roleplay
    - pretty broad, and has a lot of potential for exploring some serious things

Games Studies 101
- Game studies is very young
    - social science, humanities, industry/practice/engineering
    - it's not very cemented into academia right now
- Terminology
    - Operational logic
    - Procedural rhetoric
    - narratology vs. ludology
        - narratology: focused on story
        - ludology: focused on game mechanics, "game formalism"; has a tendency to exclude people
    - identification
        - player vs avatar
        - the incorporation of the avatar into the player
        - how does the player view themselves when they play?

Queer Studies
- this is more about the fact that we all think like queer scholars
- the studies began in the mid 80s and has been kind of hidden in departments
- academics talking about queer issues
    - a way of seeing things that are queer in whatever field you're working in
- queer studies scholars are (usually) queer
- seeing things queerly
- if we abstract it out into a way of thinking/a series of ideologies and finding the queer in things that don't seem to be queer
- what it might mean to think queerly
    - failure itself in games is a certain representation of queerness

Call out Academics!

Queer Games
- 1990s-2000
    - queer games have existed for as long as there have been games
    - marginal developers outside of AAA making these queer games
- 2010s
    - a group of people and communities making queerness in games more visible
    - notable games: dys4ia, lim, howling dogs (moving forward with Twine), mainichi, gone home
    - Twine: text based, experience based
    - some of the queer games has been spilling into more mainstream AAA tradition
- Now
    - even in the last month or so, even with Gamergate, there have been a lot of interesting queer games coming out
    - they are not from the usual voices we hear about, either
    - queer games are becoming less about a particular scene with figureheads, and more about a group of people coming together and making things

Index Cards
1. Something you want to try/learn. What do you want?

Racism, Sexism, and Social Justice Warriors in Video Game Culture
- presented by Lisa Nakamura
- "I don't think that journalism understands what journalism is" - regards to calling Anita Sarkeesian a journalist
- Gaming at the Edge by Adrienne Shaw
- Gamergate - there has been so much written about it already
- Social Justice Warrior (SJW)
    - Games have always been at the center of this
    - Straight white male is the opposite of the SJW usually (queer, female, POC)
- The idea of the gamer has changed
- UrbanDictionary definition is accusatory
    - seen as someone who is a crusader who is outside of the gaming culture
    - racialized other
    - queer women of color have always been around, but they are considered immigrants of gaming culture
    - the citation makes it clear that they're considered native to somewhere else like Livejournal and Tumblr
- There is a need for people who can add a different voice
    - You can't just add people of color to mainstream culture and expect it to be enough
- Procedural meritocracy
    - Right goes to those who can create a win condition for themselves and a lose condition for others and achieve victory for their demographics
    - "Real gamer" - this need for female players to prove themselves by beating everyone else.
- The only girl who deserves saving is the only one who doesn't need it - "the final girl"
    - the girl who gains the right to live
- "Transcending a talented tenth" - W.B. Dubois
    - disprove the alleged inferiority
    - really elitist, though, and is therefore problematic
    - cannot uplift every person, and there it results in leaving behind people
- Talented tength in the gaming community generates 133t people
- Beliving in meritocracy is not the way to go
- What are games but the posibility of happiness?
- We attach the most strongly to the things that are supposed to make you happy but also are incredibly disappointing
- Queer players are only able to match by doing well - otherwise, they are believed to not have the right to argue their point
- The game is stacked against minorities
- Games are a literal manifestation of life's discrination
- leveling up in gaming is not the way to achieve social justice
- SJW example: some games allow players the option to play as this "ideal" SJW example
    - Edge of Tomorrow
- SJW example: "bad" example because they aren't "fair" and don't play the game and aren't this ideal person
    - rude, sincere, and rejects the image of the ideal
- being tired of being the only person who brings up race or gender or sexual orientation
- some people say we should ignore Gamergate: focuses on cis hetero white males in games
- what are people outside of the norm actually doing?
    - Journey: wanted avatars to not have arms so you can't shoot people
        - speech is not possible (you can't call anyone anything)
        - claim that this is a AAA game as opposed to an independent game
- it's time for gamers and scholars ot untangle the complex world of gaming culture
- we have the gaming world's attention - what will we do with it?
- discriminatory behaviors are often blown off as just trolling
    - "it's not about expressing an opinion; it's about getting something done" 
    - claimed to be something to throw people off so that you can do better
    - a claim that it's just to get an advantage
- full essays and articles at lisanakamura.net, comments to lnakamur@umich.edu
- platform makers want to create as many channels of communication as possible
    - not all of this may be welcome, though
- it's kind of utopian idea that you can create civility through design
- still feeds into the idea of the talented tenth, where a maker reveals they're some minority after success
- why does the game create this identity for us?
    - we imagine we can earn our way
    - the idea that if we try harder, we will get half as much and that will be enough
- what is a good player?
    - games create this condition and favor certain abilities
- competition is often seen as versus
    - this has a lot to do with our own selfish wants
    - what are we doing in relation to one another
- the nature of compeitive games and the way they make money
    - undermines teaching civility
    - there are a lot of limits
    - limited by money and profit
    - minecraft as an example of competitiveness but also gives you the ability to build things
    - sandbox games represent a different posibility and more gender balanced
    - but even competitive games should (and can) have this ability to build and create in a more equal way
- outside of the gamer community into the larger culture and social justice issues and movements
    - to a certain extent in television and movies, no one wants to see these kinds of representations (or don't want their children exposed to them)
    - is there a way that things in gamer culture make it to the larger scheme of things?
    - part of the internet are made safer for people, but gaming is often seen as impossible
        - games and youtube comments are places that a lot of people have given up as safe spaces
- there are specific minorities and gaming cultures in the US, but what about internationally?
    - two tendencies that are problematic: the "white knight" (gender binary and masculinity), and the young female (the idea of sacrifice that is very feminine and needing to sacrifice their online identity to do social justice - kind of joan of arc narrative)
    - transnationality: 
        - independent publishers going out of print just like independent game makers: both have struggles with trying to stay afloat
        - try to be non-hierarchical
- drawing a line between procedural meritocracy vs. just competitiveness
    - "I don't want to discount the pleasure of kicking someone's ass"
    - issues of pleasure versus buying into the oppression/the established system
- breaking the law is part of being an SJW (often?)
- the cruel optimism that your labor will be needed if you work hard enough, but it's not really always attainable because society may not want it
    - ignoring people's needs --> draws people to games
- competitive games often rewards those who have a lot of time, and who has a lot of time?
    - privilege of having that kind of leisure time
    - women just have less leisure time than men do: don't really have that capital either compared to men
    - playing games requires a lot of capital
- farmville
    - the whole discourse about SJW is often focused on AAA games with shooter/violent games
    - social/casual games as a separate system that have many more women playing them
    - but how does this parallel ecosystem, that is more friendly to women, but how does this affect the gamer culture?
    - anxiety over the culture changing, but also the more time put into casual games, creates less for other kind of "big" games
- journey
    - competitive games make it easy for you to hate on people when they're on a team you're gaming with and they don't pull their weight
    - creation of games that encourage kindness towards other gamers
    - it's a matter of education? riot compaign for people to be really nice to each other because supposedly statistics that they do better than way
        - this only really persisted for a bit before toxicity creeped back though

Meaningful Mechanics
- presented by Margaret Rhee (virtually here), Evan Lauteria, Amanda Phillips, Edmond Chang (virtually here)
- How do mechanics work for or against social justice?
- How do we develop vocabulary for expressing this?

    - Gaming, queerness and gender
    - Not a gamer by traditional definitions but a lover of games
    - The way women are being harassed in gamergate is bring to light the need to deal with the sexism and misogyny in the industry
    - Turing also posed a question on determining the difference between male and female
    - Questions of how Turing's own sexual orientation might have influenced his work
    - Hoping to reimagine games
    - Misogyny is way too easy of a game
- Evan Lauteria :: (audio presentation/talk/thought project)
    - what resistance looks like for gamers and what it looks like in the future
    - tomogachi life --> not allowing same sex couples
        - you don't make a sim, you live your life
        - exclusionary game practices; hashtag campaign/complaint
        - there was a bug that allowed for some same sex couples, but they pushed a patch to prevent this
            - supposedly related to a bug that would cause the game to crash
            - or so they say
            - (it seems to be kind of uncertain.)
    - equality as a queer campaign
    - how culture manifests/affects campaigns
    - what does it mean to engage in queer resistence?
    - exclusion is social commentary whether you like it or not
    - nintendo seems to make their games asocial so that it's easily accessible from many cultures
    - "We're using this as an opportunity to better understand our consumers and their expectations of us at all levels of the organization."
    - Very normative trajectory: romancing, marrying, having children --> stems a lot from heteronormative culture 
    - Optional homosexuality, bisexuality, and transgender: thinking about being inclusion, language of the least resistance
        - This feels like the best way to do it without receiving a lot of backlash but it also means that it's not normalized and is just an extra
- Amanda Phillips :: (audio presentation)
    - Thinking about queer desire
    - Technologies of inclusivity
    - MassEffect
    - Heteronormative feminine and masculine positions
        - fem!Shep and bro!Shep :: bro!Shep is pretty much the same no matter what, but fem!Shep plays butch/femme depending on which partner she chooses
        - bro!Shep: are you okay with dating a human // fem!Shep: are you okay with dating a woman
        - gender also encoded onto species
    - Customizable queerness ends up coding into gender binary
        - Becomes obvious that the female version is basically a copy of the male version
    - Virgin/whore dichotomy - entirely contradictory stereotypes
    - Offloading our problematic things onto alien species
    - Women are "more difficult" because everyone has a different idea of "what a beautiful woman looks like"
        - can't go from female to male, but females can be created from a male template (for animations)
    - So much blame to the machine
    - Much investment into the white male body, which is why everything else is "hard"
    - Developers often just swap surface signifiers and fail to invest deeply in reaching inclusivity
    - Preserve gender binary and heteronormativity, even if surface effort put into swapping out a male character for a female character
    - Affirmative action practices: only really closes a gap between white men and white women
    - There aren't really answers for all of these things yet, the vocabulary and discourse around inclusivity, but it is something that needs to develop and happen
- Edmond Chang :: "Cards Against Humanity is _______"
    - Cards Against Humanity: the game is supposed to be fun and have funny things
        - strange pairings of question and answers
    - However, this game is problematic because their supposed to be funny due to coded stereotypes and racial/sexist/etc jokes
    - A lot of TW, actually...
    - Normaization of being homophobic, rape culture, etc.

    - What is the threshold for when something is too mean/cheap/problematic
    - Reveals that games often give people the agency to be assholes
    - Much of the pleasure of videogames comes at the expense of women and people of color 
    - However, while gamers can be the source of some of the most horrible comments out there, they can be the source of some of the most enlightening and meaningful comments
    - Why I Need Diverse Games
    - Games should be for humanity and encourage compassion for others
- Round Table
    - People not knowing how to "create beautiful women"
        - women, when presented as characters, don't really have any agency
        - bayonetta: criticsms based on heteronormative readings
            - this is a problem because this is a very queer game
    - Male gaze: this is something useful to think about in regarding to the objectification of women
        - however, it can impoverishes what we talk about; there's a lot more to talk about than just that
        - fem distubance: queer forms of femininity - intensify it such that it breaks the mold and creating something really queer (like bayonetta)
    - Borderlands has peripheral queerness but it was included and people don't make a huge deal out of it
        - inclusion as it pertains to token characters? is it harmful to have queer characters are token characters?
            - we lose some agency when those who are cishet determine who we are represented
            - it's not bad to be seen on the screen but it may affect our daily lives and we don't seem to have much power to control how we're presented as
            - problem when you have so few representations of queer individuals
                - but this a bit of chicken and the egg problem
            - it's not about the fact that they're in background, it's more the problem is that they're stereotyped narratives
                - queer people are never really happy in the media
            - it's a step in the right direction, perhaps
    - be careful that we don't slip into blindness and that we end up getting into "color-blindness" and "gender-blindess" and making sure that it's visible
        - the missing element of the fact that queer people's lives are often diferent and we have particular issues that we face as queer individuals that cishet people don't have to face
    - difficulty of authenticity: a lot of these stories end up being personal as a result
        - creating skins for queer characters --> the idea of "queer" visually, and making them different from cishet individuals
        - authentic identity: queerness as deconstructing identity
    - what's queer software? what's queer programming?
        - femtech net, etc.
        - what would a feminist programming language look like?
        - programming is not gender neutral
        - programming is a bit of a black box, but processing in programming needs to be looked at
        - we need to keep pushing on these things
        - technology is not neutral
            - technology with maleness encoded into it
            - facebook policy: hurts the lgbt community
            - twitter: no decent harrassment prevention
            - technology is very responsible for the culture we have now
            - tech tends to disregard the humanities a lot; forgetting about humans and how what technology affects society
    - a lot of the usage of minorities in games is for monetary gain
        - we need to have games that put in minorities not for gain but because they need to be presented and are an integral part of our every day lives
    - QGCon brings together people from a lot of communities to connect everyone and making these games visible 
    - How it is that we expect art medium to do better than our culture? 
        - this is a broad problem that needs to be addressed
    - Also slash fiction
        - this culture seems to become less and less useful as texts proliferate and the sphere expands
        - it becomes harder to find a community and a legitimate feeling of belonging
        - this is not how we're going to recouperate queer identity or community
