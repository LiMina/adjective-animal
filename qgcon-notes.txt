Bonnie Ruberg
Zoya Street

What is QGCon?
- This was started in the Metrion (?)
- An awareness that academia was behind regarding the modern gaming industry
- Create a space where academia and queer game makers and players could come together
- This is the second year of QGCon

This year:
- Gamergate is out there (and happening)
- We needed a group of people to be welcoming and comforting
- Many people are feeling unsafe and unable to voice themselves right now
- Hopefully this will be a safe space

Crash Courses
- 5 minute microtalks

Games 101
- introduction to games who aren't as familiar with games
- games were originally made of things like paper, wood, bone, etc.
    - a way to sort of make sense of the world
- machines: games became industrialized
    - particularly through computers
    - became a thing that makes money; maybe a bit exclusive
- core vs. casual
    - core: military strategy, fighting, etc.; less accessible
    - casual: experiences that are more accessible to everyone
- AAA vs. Indie
    - AAA: big, expensive games; requires a lot of time and money
    - Indie: often cheaper and more accessible for people to enjoy

A specific gaming culture around masculinity and heteronormativity
- "cuties killing video games"

The Games Industry
- currently the definition of games is mostly digital
- 1950s: first games distributed on computers (also the first indie games appeared)
- Academia was the only place you could kind of play on computers, so it became a bit privileged.
- AAA
    - a small set of games produced with huge budgets
    - for a while, this was the only thing that people saw
    - played on consoles or PCs with a narrow set of themes
- Indie
    - late 2000s, we start to see these games more visibly
    - these had been around but not really out there to the public
    - iPhones, Wii, these technologies began to change who played games
- F2P
    - free to play / freemium
    - defined by how it makes money
    - gives you a small amount of enjoyment; you can pay to accelerate how much fun you have with it though
- Serious Games
    - defined by thematic content
    - disease, public policy, etc.
- Experimental
    - defined by what things are played on/with
- LARP
    - live action roleplay
    - pretty broad, and has a lot of potential for exploring some serious things

Games Studies 101
- Game studies is very young
    - social science, humanities, industry/practice/engineering
    - it's not very cemented into academia right now
- Terminology
    - Operational logic
    - Procedural rhetoric
    - narratology vs. ludology
        - narratology: focused on story
        - ludology: focused on game mechanics, "game formalism"; has a tendency to exclude people
    - identification
        - player vs avatar
        - the incorporation of the avatar into the player
        - how does the player view themselves when they play?

Queer Studies
- this is more about the fact that we all think like queer scholars
- the studies began in the mid 80s and has been kind of hidden in departments
- academics talking about queer issues
    - a way of seeing things that are queer in whatever field you're working in
- queer studies scholars are (usually) queer
- seeing things queerly
- if we abstract it out into a way of thinking/a series of ideologies and finding the queer in things that don't seem to be queer
- what it might mean to think queerly
    - failure itself in games is a certain representation of queerness

Call out Academics!

Queer Games
- 1990s-2000
    - queer games have existed for as long as there have been games
    - marginal developers outside of AAA making these queer games
- 2010s
    - a group of people and communities making queerness in games more visible
    - notable games: dys4ia, lim, howling dogs (moving forward with Twine), mainichi, gone home
    - Twine: text based, experience based
    - some of the queer games has been spilling into more mainstream AAA tradition
- Now
    - even in the last month or so, even with Gamergate, there have been a lot of interesting queer games coming out
    - they are not from the usual voices we hear about, either
    - queer games are becoming less about a particular scene with figureheads, and more about a group of people coming together and making things

Index Cards
1. Something you want to try/learn. What do you want?
2. Something that you want to let go of.

Racism, Sexism, and Social Justice Warriors in Video Game Culture

- "I don't think that journalism understands what journalism is" - regards to calling Anita Sarkeesian a journalist
- Gaming at the Edge by Adrienne Shaw
- Gamergate - there has been so much written about it already

- The idea of the gamer has changed
- UrbanDictionary definition is accusatory
    - seen as someone who is a crusader who is outside of the gaming culture
    - racialized other
    - queer women of color have always been around, but they are considered immigrants of gaming culture
    - the citation makes it clear that they're considered native to somewhere else like Livejournal and Tumblr
- There is a need for people who can add a different voice
    - You can't just add people of color to mainstream culture and expect it to be enough
- Procedural meritocracy
    - Right goes to those who can create a win condition for themselves and a lose condition for others and achieve victory for their demographics
    - "Real gamer" - this need for female players to prove themselves by beating everyone else.
- The only girl who deserves saving is the only one who doesn't need it - "the final girl"
    - the girl who gains the right to live
- "Transcending a talented tenth" - W.B. Dubois
    - disprove the alleged inferiority
    - really elitist, though, and is therefore problematic
    - cannot uplift every person, and there it results in leaving behind people
- Talented tength in the gaming community generates 133t people
- Beliving in meritocracy is not the way to go
- What are games but the posibility of happiness?
- We attach the most strongly to the things that are supposed to make you happy but also are incredibly disappointing
- Queer players are only able to match by doing well - otherwise, they are believed to not have the right to argue their point
- The game is stacked against minorities
- Games are a literal manifestation of life's discrination
- leveling up in gaming is not the way to achieve social justice
- SJW example: some games allow players the option to play as this "ideal" SJW example
    - Edge of Tomorrow
- SJW example: "bad" example because they aren't "fair" and don't play the game and aren't this ideal person
    - rude, sincere, and rejects the image of the ideal

    - Journey: wanted avatars to not have arms so you can't shoot people
        - speech is not possible (you can't call anyone anything)
        - claim that this is a AAA game as opposed to an independent game
- it's time for gamers and scholars ot untangle the complex world of gaming culture
- we have the gaming world's attention - what will we do with it?
- discriminatory behaviors are often blown off as just trolling
    - "it's not about expressing an opinion; it's about getting something done" 
    - claimed to be something to throw people off so that you can do better
    - a claim that it's just to get an advantage
- full essays and articles at lisanakamura.net, comments to lnakamur@umich.edu
- platform makers want to create as many channels of communication as possible
    - not all of this may be welcome, though
- it's kind of utopian idea that you can create civility through design
- still feeds into the idea of the talented tenth, where a maker reveals they're some minority after success
- why does the game create this identity for us?
    - we imagine we can earn our way
    - the idea that if we try harder, we will get half as much and that will be enough
- what is a good player?
    - games create this condition and favor certain abilities
- competition is often seen as versus
    - this has a lot to do with our own selfish wants
    - what are we doing in relation to one another
- the nature of compeitive games and the way they make money
    - undermines teaching civility
    - there are a lot of limits
    - limited by money and profit
    - minecraft as an example of competitiveness but also gives you the ability to build things
    - sandbox games represent a different posibility and more gender balanced
    - but even competitive games should (and can) have this ability to build and create in a more equal way
- outside of the gamer community into the larger culture and social justice issues and movements
    - to a certain extent in television and movies, no one wants to see these kinds of representations (or don't want their children exposed to them)
    - is there a way that things in gamer culture make it to the larger scheme of things?
    - part of the internet are made safer for people, but gaming is often seen as impossible
        - games and youtube comments are places that a lot of people have given up as safe spaces
- there are specific minorities and gaming cultures in the US, but what about internationally?
    - two tendencies that are problematic: the "white knight" (gender binary and masculinity), and the young female (the idea of sacrifice that is very feminine and needing to sacrifice their online identity to do social justice - kind of joan of arc narrative)
    - transnationality: 
        - independent publishers going out of print just like independent game makers: both have struggles with trying to stay afloat
        - try to be non-hierarchical
- drawing a line between procedural meritocracy vs. just competitiveness
    - "I don't want to discount the pleasure of kicking someone's ass"
    - issues of pleasure versus buying into the oppression/the established system
- breaking the law is part of being an SJW (often?)
- the cruel optimism that your labor will be needed if you work hard enough, but it's not really always attainable because society may not want it
    - ignoring people's needs --> draws people to games
- competitive games often rewards those who have a lot of time, and who has a lot of time?
    - privilege of having that kind of leisure time
    - women just have less leisure time than men do: don't really have that capital either compared to men
    - playing games requires a lot of capital
- farmville
    - the whole discourse about SJW is often focused on AAA games with shooter/violent games
    - social/casual games as a separate system that have many more women playing them
    - but how does this parallel ecosystem, that is more friendly to women, but how does this affect the gamer culture?
    - anxiety over the culture changing, but also the more time put into casual games, creates less for other kind of "big" games
- journey
    - competitive games make it easy for you to hate on people when they're on a team you're gaming with and they don't pull their weight
    - creation of games that encourage kindness towards other gamers
    - it's a matter of education? riot compaign for people to be really nice to each other because supposedly statistics that they do better than way
        - this only really persisted for a bit before toxicity creeped back though

Meaningful Mechanics
- presented by Margaret Rhee (virtually here), Evan Lauteria, Amanda Phillips, Edmond Chang (virtually here)
- How do mechanics work for or against social justice?
- How do we develop vocabulary for expressing this?

    - Gaming, queerness and gender
    - Not a gamer by traditional definitions but a lover of games
    - The way women are being harassed in gamergate is bring to light the need to deal with the sexism and misogyny in the industry
    - Turing also posed a question on determining the difference between male and female
    - Questions of how Turing's own sexual orientation might have influenced his work
    - Hoping to reimagine games
    - Misogyny is way too easy of a game
- Evan Lauteria :: (audio presentation/talk/thought project)
    - what resistance looks like for gamers and what it looks like in the future
    - tomogachi life --> not allowing same sex couples
        - you don't make a sim, you live your life
        - exclusionary game practices; hashtag campaign/complaint
        - there was a bug that allowed for some same sex couples, but they pushed a patch to prevent this
            - supposedly related to a bug that would cause the game to crash
            - or so they say
            - (it seems to be kind of uncertain.)
    - equality as a queer campaign
    - how culture manifests/affects campaigns
    - what does it mean to engage in queer resistence?
    - exclusion is social commentary whether you like it or not
    - nintendo seems to make their games asocial so that it's easily accessible from many cultures
    - "We're using this as an opportunity to better understand our consumers and their expectations of us at all levels of the organization."
    - Very normative trajectory: romancing, marrying, having children --> stems a lot from heteronormative culture 
    - Optional homosexuality, bisexuality, and transgender: thinking about being inclusion, language of the least resistance
        - This feels like the best way to do it without receiving a lot of backlash but it also means that it's not normalized and is just an extra
- Amanda Phillips :: (audio presentation)
    - Thinking about queer desire
    - Technologies of inclusivity
    - MassEffect
    - Heteronormative feminine and masculine positions
        - fem!Shep and bro!Shep :: bro!Shep is pretty much the same no matter what, but fem!Shep plays butch/femme depending on which partner she chooses
        - bro!Shep: are you okay with dating a human // fem!Shep: are you okay with dating a woman
        - gender also encoded onto species
    - Customizable queerness ends up coding into gender binary
        - Becomes obvious that the female version is basically a copy of the male version
    - Virgin/whore dichotomy - entirely contradictory stereotypes
    - Offloading our problematic things onto alien species
    - Women are "more difficult" because everyone has a different idea of "what a beautiful woman looks like"
        - can't go from female to male, but females can be created from a male template (for animations)
    - So much blame to the machine
    - Much investment into the white male body, which is why everything else is "hard"
    - Developers often just swap surface signifiers and fail to invest deeply in reaching inclusivity
    - Preserve gender binary and heteronormativity, even if surface effort put into swapping out a male character for a female character
    - Affirmative action practices: only really closes a gap between white men and white women
    - There aren't really answers for all of these things yet, the vocabulary and discourse around inclusivity, but it is something that needs to develop and happen
- Edmond Chang :: "Cards Against Humanity is _______"
    - Cards Against Humanity: the game is supposed to be fun and have funny things
        - strange pairings of question and answers
    - However, this game is problematic because their supposed to be funny due to coded stereotypes and racial/sexist/etc jokes
    - A lot of TW, actually...
    - Normaization of being homophobic, rape culture, etc.
    - "Passable transvestites" was a card and Jonah Miller made headlines by burning the card; one of the makers apologized for it and said that it was taken out of the game
    - What is the threshold for when something is too mean/cheap/problematic
    - Reveals that games often give people the agency to be assholes
    - Much of the pleasure of videogames comes at the expense of women and people of color 
    - However, while gamers can be the source of some of the most horrible comments out there, they can be the source of some of the most enlightening and meaningful comments
    - Why I Need Diverse Games
    - Games should be for humanity and encourage compassion for others
- Round Table
    - People not knowing how to "create beautiful women"
        - women, when presented as characters, don't really have any agency
        - bayonetta: criticsms based on heteronormative readings
            - this is a problem because this is a very queer game
    - Male gaze: this is something useful to think about in regarding to the objectification of women
        - however, it can impoverishes what we talk about; there's a lot more to talk about than just that
        - fem distubance: queer forms of femininity - intensify it such that it breaks the mold and creating something really queer (like bayonetta)
    - Borderlands has peripheral queerness but it was included and people don't make a huge deal out of it
        - inclusion as it pertains to token characters? is it harmful to have queer characters are token characters?
            - we lose some agency when those who are cishet determine who we are represented
            - it's not bad to be seen on the screen but it may affect our daily lives and we don't seem to have much power to control how we're presented as
            - problem when you have so few representations of queer individuals
                - but this a bit of chicken and the egg problem
            - it's not about the fact that they're in background, it's more the problem is that they're stereotyped narratives
                - queer people are never really happy in the media
            - it's a step in the right direction, perhaps
    - be careful that we don't slip into blindness and that we end up getting into "color-blindness" and "gender-blindess" and making sure that it's visible
        - the missing element of the fact that queer people's lives are often diferent and we have particular issues that we face as queer individuals that cishet people don't have to face
    - difficulty of authenticity: a lot of these stories end up being personal as a result
        - creating skins for queer characters --> the idea of "queer" visually, and making them different from cishet individuals
        - authentic identity: queerness as deconstructing identity
    - what's queer software? what's queer programming?
        - femtech net, etc.
        - what would a feminist programming language look like?
        - programming is not gender neutral
        - programming is a bit of a black box, but processing in programming needs to be looked at
        - we need to keep pushing on these things
        - technology is not neutral
            - technology with maleness encoded into it
            - facebook policy: hurts the lgbt community
            - twitter: no decent harrassment prevention
            - technology is very responsible for the culture we have now
            - tech tends to disregard the humanities a lot; forgetting about humans and how what technology affects society
    - a lot of the usage of minorities in games is for monetary gain
        - we need to have games that put in minorities not for gain but because they need to be presented and are an integral part of our every day lives
    - QGCon brings together people from a lot of communities to connect everyone and making these games visible 
    - How it is that we expect art medium to do better than our culture? 
        - this is a broad problem that needs to be addressed
    - Also slash fiction
        - this culture seems to become less and less useful as texts proliferate and the sphere expands
        - it becomes harder to find a community and a legitimate feeling of belonging
        - this is not how we're going to recouperate queer identity or community

Asexuality and Videogames
- presented Squinky Kiai and Ianna Owen
- 101 on Asexuality
    - the quality of not being interested in sex/not having a sex drive
    - there are many answer
    - contrasted with allosexual (sp?)
    - in between grey-asexual, demisexual
    - asexual community likes to make up words for things
    - grey-asexual: this takes many forms
    - demisexual: only have sexual attraction to those they have formed close emotional attachment to
    - sexual vs romantic attraction
        - asexual individuals may still have romantic attraction
    - difference between sexual attraction vs sexual drive
        - some asexuals have sex drives but not sexual attraction
    - it does not matter where your asexual stems from  
        - a lot of cultural narrative is that asexual people are broken
    - sex-repulsed applies to some asexual individuals
    - the difficulty of living in such a sex-saturated society
    - the difficulty of gender identity with sexual touch
        - but also how it sometimes opens up comfort with sexual interaction at times
- Intersectionality
    - absence: media representations of asexuality
        - characters who are treated as asexual because...well, they don't do anything that's seemingly sexual
        - however, when characters are asexual, how do we represent them in ways that humanizes them
        - rpg and visual novel with asexuality; a lot of the time when you choose no sex, it ends the relationship
    - what is sex?
        - it's a ramp; there are a lot of diverging paths that asexual individuals take and different comfort levels
        - desire for many different things and how sex in society is put on this pedastal
    - accomodation of games that don't have sexual content in them (like candy crush)
        - can be much more comfortable for asexual indiiduals
        - it can't really be considered an asexual game, though
    - difficult to represent what is different without actively pointing it out
    - problem of creating stereotypes and archetypes of asexual by trying to collect a body of people who are asexual
    - the invisible orientation: it's hard to recognize in society in a way because there's no stereotype
        - it's hard to want to be defined by an absence
    - giving a 101 on your orientation can be a painful experience and relive how non-normative you are
    - addressing the concept of asexuality through metaphor or through other means
        - a game where everyone loves to do X and your character does not love to do it and how no one otherstands
        - set up a scene that would be really romantic or sexual and just have it...not be.
        - could just have a lot of character bios
    - being aware that you can create a game for a small audience and not do a 101
    - games addressing asexuality do not *have* to remove sex entirely
    - don't make assumptions: just have a path through a game that has sex to not be a motivation
    - mainstream artists/producers/etc. step on people who talk about their characters as asexual
        - why do they feel the need to crush the idea? can't they just leave it open ended?
    - asexuality is often not addressed in queer spaces
        - it's good to have it included in these spaces
    - asexual erasure related to bisexual erasure
    - there is a need to be specific as well as inclusive

Enabling Realities :: Brenda Laurel
- computational media department
- compassionate design for those who have been left out of the computer revolution
- purple moon
- why don't girls play computer games?
    - girls afraid of breaking things
- what kind of gmaes would girls play?
    - text adventures, pacman (girls like it because it was about an eating disorder)
- it's remarkable how girls describe their social structures at school both at the child and teen level
    - model created by cheskin
    - popular kids: 30-45% (athletes, cheerleaders, etc; visibly attractive, academically mediocre, overperformed in heteronormative behavior)
    - status quo kids: 25-35% (more normative, average kids, tend to go to church more often and go to boy/girl scouts
    - non teens: 15% (very smart, "nerds", tend to be modeled on adults)
    - isolator: 10% (difficulties financially, don't have much of a community, tend to get in trouble in school)
    - explorers: 10% (trendsetters, music makers, create alternative representations of themselves)
- I just knew.
- Gender performance (hard to ask about gender identity)
    - overperformance of gender
- gender signaling queues determining who can play with what toys

- dolphin with blood/fangs
- barbie in GI Joe clothing (No one likes the vacant stare)
- Purple Moon is part of a larger movement of girls in games
- girl games, gender war
- there aren't really bad guys here so much as people who don't get along and have differences in views
- what does it mean to be designing for someone
    - designing for yourself is pretty easy: create world where we can be comfortable as ourselves
    - a lot of the gaming industry was formed from this but then the people designing games began to design for money and fame
    - this eventually resulted in homogenization
- never alone (upper one games)
    - comes out novemeber 18, 2014
    - this should be a really exciting game that reveals that narrative of people who are rarely represented
    - capturing real people's experiences and stories
- both first and second wave feminists had similar goals
    - change status of women in the world
    - feminisms split around issues of temperance and race (first)
    - split along sexuality (sex positive/pornography) (second)
    - gender feminists (gender purity)
    - equity feminists (more focused on equality across genders)
- girls and boys have biological differences
    - essentialist! - says accusations
    - learning about insensitivities towards transgender community
    - some feminists are still very against transgender individuals
- problems with the chromosonal view
    - it's become apparent that these chromosonal mashups are much more common than previously thought
    - chimerism/mosaicism
- gender purity does not exist.
- seeking gender purity is a fool's errand
- (I am grateful for her honesty and her emotion in her talk. I feel my own heart swelling.)
- we don't need any more separatism. our country is about to break over it
- humanism has to prevail, one way or another.
- the importance of visibility of disability in games
    - we can do this with the technology we have
    - we can also show that people with disabilities are OK
    - games can do a lot better
- the challenge of conveying everything you want to say via Twitter: it's limiting, seriously.
    - it can also come off more abrasive than you intended it to be
- there is no safe space - there are only safer places

DAY 2: October 26, 2014

Designing Inclusive Communities
- lead by Sarah Schoemann
- Talking about what communities we're a part of and affiliate strongly with
    - divided into Conferences and Twitter
- Improvements
    - Twitter
        - non-linear style of conversations
        - 140 character limit (can't capture everything and leads to misunderstanding; however, it makes reading concise)
        - open-nature (double-edged - can be harrassed easily, but means it's a very open environment for conversation as well)
        - implicit social conduct/constraints (don't interupt people's conversations or jump into one that you're not a part of; but people do this anyhow)
        - having safe spaces; twitter doesn't handle this well and has poor moderation
    - Conferences
        - access privilege; inability to attend do to financial and/or physical reasons
        - can be easy to feel that the conference is accessible if you're within the conference and its target audience but sometimes hard to recognize when it is excluding people
        - social anxiety for some people
        - codes of conduct written but not enforced
    - both
        - people getting defensive about being called out and unwilling to admit mistakes
        - harrassment, sexism/misogyny
- Pros of QGCon
    - racial diversity, acknowledging privilege, good representation of people, being graceful about being called out

Queering Human-Game Relations
- by Merritt Kopas and Naomi Clark
- Queer has been reinterpretted as an escape
    - this is not equal to LGBTSTQIA
    - not equal to any particular sexual/gender minority
    - this is an ever changing term, that comes with its own politics
    - a questioning of what the normative is
- being aware of using terms like "beyond marriage" as opposed to "against marriage"
- don't let obvious, photogenic answers limit you
- queer characters often put in for reactions and a way to avoid certain politics
- queer mechanics: rules can oppose norms as opposed ot just content representing what is queer
- queer studies were born out of fields like film studies, which is often focused on content
- the idea that games are inherently queer because it is a safe space to fail (this is challenged later in the talk)
- rejecting rules is queerness
- games encourage capitalism; reinforces cishet normative goals (marriage, etc.)
- rehabilitating the notion of the gamer, trying to leave behind the stereotype of the game
- obsession of the representation/visualization of items in games, in particular violence
- marketing problem of board games historically
    - dice were seen as gambling, so gamemakers switched to using the spinner as the new PRNG
    - games became considered as a thing for the family
    - technology and games develop together
- casino as the institutionalized form of gambling
- Kriegs Spiel was a strategy practice for generals and became the basis of games such as Dungeons and DRagons
    - a lot of games (if not all) spring from the industrialization and warfare in society
- The tension of games as a place between productive and unproductive
- The Grasshopper: Games Life and Utopia
    - retelling/reflection/play off of Aesop's fable story
- Evangialist games
    - games can make the world a better place? No.
    - maybe games should just be purely for fun with no practical/social/political value? No.
- Games are often libidinal profiteers
- "Games need to be saved!" Nah.
- Games are a cultural fantasy: how we believe or want our world to work
- War games are a projection and just not how real war is.
- Most videogames have simple/straightforward goals, unlike real life
- Games reinforce competitive culture
    - why is it that many people fall out of games because of failure
    - consideration that games are childish
    - a reminder of gender/sexuality oppression sometimes
- competitiveness <--> capitalist mindset (victory, winning, success)
- Games have real lasting damage on queer individuals
    - many queers do not feel games are a safe space to fail (fail better, fail harder)
- Games are a good way to learn about how to fit into the system/ how to be good participants in the system
- Experience of failure is deeply painful
    - failure to achieve proper gender
- Rejected human centric perspective in research
- Games as less tools such much as actors who have been doing things to and for us
- We don't spend much time thinking about what they do to us and what we do to them?
    - disciplining process
    - training systems, only a relentless push towards efficient work
    - reinforce particular dominant views of the world
- Alientation of play
    - not sure how to play outside of games sometimes
    - games used to discipline ourselves
- What are the alternatives?
- Glitches: agency in glitches (not intentional glitches)
    - power and meaning in not revealing if a glitch is intentional or not
- We close ourselves to such glitches to achieve code perfection
- Reject games as friendly objects and have games that challenge the game experience
- Chess
    - starts out a total equilibrium; curiously equal and unrealistic (same as Go)
- Games exist that start in desequilibrium, but are less common (this is changing in recent years)
- what disruptions are caused in game play?
- competiting understandings of queerness
- question that queerness opposes utility (this shouldn't continue)
- new ways to relate to play
- glitches: some, in particular, are repeatedly used
    - however, this diminishes their effect and are usually just visual
    - glitches should be organic, generated from the interaction of the gamemaker with the game
- glitches and intentionally chaotic systems
    - chaotic systems are more likely to produce glitches but chaotic systems are not glitches in and of themselves
- abstract glitches
    - game mechanics like teleporting through the walls, which can actually mess up the game
- open world games --> colonist fantasy?
- disciplining action of the screen/physical limitation
    - technology advancements affect how we play physically, but there is usually a fixed relationship between screen and player
    - this may be changing with the development of the oculus rift, though

Kinky, Queer, Disruptive
- talks that bring together language of kink
- thinking about desire differently
- Jetta Rae: A Series of Pictures of Pinball To Accompany My Monologue
    - what does this have to do with consent and queerness?
    - consent: this is not just a thing that is given and traded
        - power structures and differentials, and frameworks in which you can agree to something
    - the opposite: not necessarily non-consent
        - conquest
        - the idea that sex is not something you share but something you take and obtain and win
        - assigned value to various partners and the worth between having sex with different people
    - the gender binary that exists, and we assign value to people in our sexual encounters
        - have to play by a standard of values and tools by which we judge people
        - reduces sex into a supermarket sweep
    - gamergate: a push towards a universal standard
        - games you literally hump to win
    - what is a pinball machine?
        - there is no universal standard; every pinball game has a set of rules, but...
        - no such thing as being good at pinball because there's no universal standard
        - you just move around and collaborate with the machine
    - in the same vein, there is no such thing as "good at sex"
        - you're either a good listener, or you're not.
    - queer sexuality: we must make an active movement 
    - consent is a unique set of rules
        - i encourage you to consider each relationship that you have as a unique set of rules
    - in the way that pinball is not compulsarily forced into standard makes it beautiful
    - as we define queerness in gaming, we also be mindful to resist the urge and the temptation to resist to set constitutions
    - if we try to set hard limits to what defines queerness and kink, we run the risk of alientating ourselves, and right now we really need each other

    - ***this seems to mostly be a reading of her paper, so I would recommend reading her paper as opposed to having me try to take notes***

        - push Chell past her limits (in the same way as sadomachoism seems to work)

        - Cave Johnson was a paternal figure
        - It is Chell's potato plant that GLaDOS gets transfered into it
        - GLaDOS manages to escape Cave Johnson's paternal role and becomes maternal figure to Chell?
    - Pain to extend beyond perceived limitations, both Chell and GLaDOS move beyond their roles and move into a romantic relationship? (hm)

    - overturning of paternal relationship in sadomasochism
- Jonatan Yde: Game Odditites - Exploring queer presence in mainstream and commonly accepted games

        - but it really is a story about midlife crisis and is not really a horror story at all

    - (and one more, whose name I didn't quite catch)
    - pinball community: consideration of giving up old pinball machines to be mod-ed to be able to continue the culture
    - does GLaDOS's consent matter if she is the one inflicting? when we see that Chell as masochistic.

Gender/Play
- presented by Sarah Lynne Bowman, Hanna Brady and Derrek Burrill
- Sarah Lynne Bowman :: Infiltrating Bofer Larp with Drag: Challenging Gender Performance through Role-playing Games
    - what we're lacking: good documentation
    - discussing drag
        - how do drag characters relate to role-playing characters
        - drag has its own geek subculture
        - exaggerated forms of femininity
        - RuPaul's Drag Race has come under a lot of fire and also works to enforce heteronormativity
            - but, there are some trans people who have come out through the show, and other good snippets
    - Live Action Role-Playing (LARP)
    - Dystopia Rising Lone Star
        - This is somewaht similar to Cthulhu (horror game; slavery + other interesting social commentaries)
        - Grimmy, gritty aesthetic
        - Conspicuous consumption of the pure strain (interesting that she chooses to play as this strain)
        - It is a game about killing zombies but also a game about community
        - Religious ritual in the game
            - Telingvisionists? (Play on Evangelists)
    - (I apologize, but this section on religion is a bit hard for me to swallow and I'm going to stop taking notes on this.)
    - I'm glad that there is a welcoming/open environemnt LGBT+ things in this, I guess...

        - making children familiar with many different relationships between people
        - there is no correct version of a story
        - there should not be just one version of a fairy tail, and it's pretty scary that fairy tales are being homogenized
    - the girl she truly was (cinderella story about a transwoman)
